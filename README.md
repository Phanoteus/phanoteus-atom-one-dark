# Phanoteus Atom One Dark Theme

Another VS Code theme based on the One Dark theme from [Mahmoud Ali](https://github.com/akamud).

Mahmoud's theme is, in turn, based on Atom's [One Dark](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax) theme.

I just wanted to make some simple adjustments to the theme for my own use.
